<h1>Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Week-4-Assignment</h1>
<br>
This project includes four files: README.md, codebook.md, run_analysis.R, tidy_data.txt

<h3>Followings are done:</h3>

download and unzip the data in the working directory.<br>
Load the dataset: X_train.txt, X_test.txt, Y_train.txt, Y_test.txt, subject_train.txt, subject_test.txt, features.txt, activity_labels.txt.<br>
Merge the X_train and X_test.txt.<br>
Merge the Y_train and Y_test.txt.<br>
Merge the subject_train and subject_test.<br>
extract the measurements based on mean and standard deviation.<br>
Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.<br>
Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.<br>
Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
